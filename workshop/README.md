## Get the Cert: Learn how to build your next app with Kubernetes, Istio and advanced services like Watson

- Date: Monday, December 10, 2018
- Time: 12:00 PM – 4:00 PM
- Registration Fees: Free

Do you need to select the right technologies to build the next productivity app in your application backlog? Get your hands dirty with those technologies before you start your build. Learn how Kubernetes and Istio make it easy to bind your app to advanced services like Watson, Blockchain, and IoT. Our developers will walk you through the step-by-step in this Hands-on-Lab, and you’ll walk away with a certification badge.

Kubernetes minimize outages and disruptions through self-healing, intelligent scheduling, horizontal scaling, and load balancing. Developers can easily roll out and roll back application versions, whether they’re collaborating in development and test environments or deploying to production. Even new application functionality is streamlined, when developers extend apps with cloud services.
The Result: Spend more time coding and less time with the infrastructure.

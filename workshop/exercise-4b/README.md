# Exercise 4 - Logging and Monitoring

## Using IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA

IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA is a third-party service that you can include as part of your IBM Cloud architecture to add log management capabilities. IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA is operated by LogDNA in partnership with IBM.

The service plan that you choose for an IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA instance defines the number of days that data is stored and retained in LogDNA. For example, if you choose the Free plan, data is not stored at all. However, if you choose the 7 day plan, data is stored for 7 days and you have access to it through the LogDNA Web UI.

## Configure your cluster with LogDNA

1. From the IBM Cloud Dashboard, select your Account from the top menu bar.
2. Create an instance of LogDNA
   1. Click on **Catalog** in the top menu bar.
   2. Search for `IBM Log Analysis with LogDNA`
   3. Select the location where your cluster is created (eu-de).
   4. Use the default resource group.
   5. Click **Create**.
3. Click **Edit log sources**:
   1. Select **Kubernetes** as a source
   2. Run the listed commands against your Kubernetes cluster in the web terminal window.

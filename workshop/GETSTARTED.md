# Get Started
In this section, you will create your own IBM Cloud account, and then get access to a IBM Cloud Lab account which contains pre-provisioned clusters. Each lab attendee will be granted access to one cluster. 

1. Create your own [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com).
2. Go to [Get Cluster](https://get-cluster.mybluemix.net) web page and enter your IBM ID (the email you used to sign up) and the lab key `istiorocks`.
3. You will be added to the Lab account and granted access to a cluster.
4. Refresh your [IBM Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com)
5. Switch to the **IBM** account by clicking on the account selection drop down in the top nav bar. 
6. Click on **View all** in the Resource Summary tile.
7. Under **Kubernetes Clusters**, click on the cluster that has been assigned to you.

You will use this cluster for this lab. Note that this is a *Standard/Paid* cluster (as opposed to FREE cluster.)

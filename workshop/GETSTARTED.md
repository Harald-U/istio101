# Get Started
In this section, you will login to your own IBM Cloud account, and then get access to a IBM Cloud Lab account which contains pre-provisioned clusters. Each lab attendee will be granted access to one cluster.

1. You should already have a federated IBM Cloud account using your company email address, confirm by logging in to https://cloud.ibm.com
2. If you do not have an account, you could create your own [IBM Cloud account](https://ibm.biz/Bdzybn).
4. Go to [Grant Cluster](http://grant-cluster-iks.mybluemix.net) web page and enter your IBM ID (the email you used to sign up), the lab key from the instructor, and select the `Frankfurt (EU-Central / eu-de)` region.
